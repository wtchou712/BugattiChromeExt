Bugatti is a Chrome extension and web page that allows users to one-click order postmates delivery.

The web page allows users to create and customize their favorite foods, which are then saved to their account. The Chrome extension will keep track of the users favorite foods so that they can instantly order from the extension with just one click. The user is prompted of their order confirmation, time estimate, and phone number.

Technical details: 
The web page stores user information and favorite foods onto a database which the extension accesses. When a user clicks the extension, they will be prompted to login, or if they are already logged in, a list of their favorite foods will be loaded. Once the user clicks a favorite food, the extension will send a request to the server. The server then sends a request through the Postmates API to fulfill a delivery request, and then sends the delivery information back to the extension. The delivery information is used to prompt the user with an order confirmation, delivery time estimate, and cost.
